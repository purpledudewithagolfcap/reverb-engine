# real-time Roblox reverb system
Yeah honest to god I'll never do this shit again. 

  I've spent too much time on this, but here are some features.
  
1: Late reflection and early reflection.

2: An overly complex reflection system (s

3: absorption simulation

4: Uses Ray-tracing (not like the RTX light ray thing one) to determine the reverberation

5: adjustable sample size (5 is recommended)

6: Applies to most if not every sound possible in the Workspace

7: Takes into consideration the room's size and such

8: Each material has its value like Density and Absorption.

9: Adjustable distance reach

10: Takes into consideration the distance between rays and the impact point

11: frequency-dependent absorption (some frequencies get absorbed better in different materials)

12: Diffuse reflection (random reflection but more cooler)

13: Room mode. (search it again)

14: I can't name many other features, but they exist if you consider them.

# Other features I haven't added but will be a thing soon:

can't think of any yet. But I'll see if I can find something maybe

I would have added more features, but the school laptop blocks everything related to coding except this. They blocked most of the websites I researched to get these results. I'll add them here when i get on my actual pc also don't forget about it

# PLEASE READ
If you do use this code. it's optional but please credit me. I won't do anything but I'll love it
