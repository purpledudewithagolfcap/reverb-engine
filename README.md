# Real-time ray-traced audio enhancer (reverb system for short)
Yeah honest to god I'll never do this shit again. 
  I've spent too much time on this, but here are some features.
  
1: Late reflection and early reflection.

2: An overly complex reflection system

3: absorption simulation

4: Uses Ray-tracing (not like the RTX light ray thing one) to determine the reverberation

5: adjustable sample size (5 is recommended)

6: Applies to most if not every sound possible in the Workspace

7: Takes into consideration the room's size and such

8: Each material has its value like Density and Absorption.

9: Adjustable distance reach

10: Takes into consideration the distance between rays and the impact point

11: I can't name many other features right now, but they do exist if you're thinking of them.

# Other features I haven't added but will be a thing soon:

Diffuse reflection (search it up).

I would have added more features, but the school laptop blocks everything related to coding except this. They blocked most of the websites I researched to get these results.

# "Why no code work?"

Also if you're asking "Why does the code not work when I put it into ReplicatedStorage?" Well, I'm not just going to release the entire source code. there is another ModuleScript that I am not showing you. You can only inspect and see the code. Until I'm done with it I'm not going to release the code officially until later notice
